# Sample Slack Bot
Let's explore Events API. 
* The tutorial is loosely based on these two tutorials 
  [[1](https://github.com/slackapi/python-slack-sdk/tree/main/tutorial),
  [2](https://api.slack.com/start/building/bolt-python)].
* Create your own bot message using [Block Kit Builder](https://app.slack.com/block-kit-builder/).
* Keep in mind that you will need a public URL to interact with the bot (if you are not using Socket Mode). 
  Slack recommends using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com).
